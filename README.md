# Corneal-Ulcers-The-SUSTech-SYSU-Classification-CNN-Resnet50v2
This repository contains a training of the Resnet50v2 fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network model for corneal eye ulcer classification. The model successfully performs classification with Category, Type, and Grade classification types or scenarios. This training also shows the effect of data leakage on the separation of training data and validation data which can give overly optimistic results.
